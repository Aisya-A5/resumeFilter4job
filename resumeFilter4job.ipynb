            "- The candidate, Jesse Millwood, does not explicitly mention programming skills or application development experience, which are highlighted as crucial in the job description. Although his data analysis skills imply potential for system optimization, there's no direct evidence of coding or application development expertise.\n",
            "- While Jesse has extensive experience in business analysis roles, including system testing and optimization, there is no indication of direct involvement in designing or upgrading information systems as specified in the job description.\n",
            "- Although Jesse has a Bachelor's degree in Marketing and has pursued an MIS course, the job description specifically seeks a candidate with a background in Computer Science or Information Technology, which is not evident in his educational background.\n",
            "- Jesse's experience is primarily in the insurance sector (HUB International, Idaho Falls; Idaho Central Credit Union, Twin Falls), with no mention of working in digital solutions or technology innovation, as emphasized by PT Metrodata Electronics, Tbk.\n",
            "- Despite having strong skills in cross-functional collaboration, critical thinking, and customer requirement gathering, these competencies are common across many roles and do not specifically address the technical requirements outlined in the job description.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, Jesse Millwood's resume showcases a strong business analysis background with relevant skills, but it lacks the explicit programming expertise and application development experience that the job description prioritizes. His educational background also does not align with the Computer Science/Information Technology requirement specified by PT Metrodata Electronics, Tbk.\n"
